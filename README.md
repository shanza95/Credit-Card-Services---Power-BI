# Credit-Card-Services---Power-BI 

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building an interactive Credit Card Customer Insights Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of customer behavior, credit utilization, transaction activity, financial outcomes, and risk indicators. By integrating key credit card metrics, the dashboard helps business teams, analysts, and decision-makers understand patterns that drive profitability, customer satisfaction, and risk exposure.

## Workflow: CSV --> MySQL --> Power BI
*(Why not upload CSVs directly to Power BI)*

1. CSV files are imported into MySQL via Python
   - Python handles data transformation and automation.
   - MySQL acts as a central, scalable repository for multiple CSVs and large datasets.
3. Power BI connects to MySQL for reporting
   - Dashboards are built on clean, consistent data.
   - No need to manually refresh CSvs or worry about duplicates.
